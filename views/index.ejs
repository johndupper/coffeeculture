            <h2>The Case for Drinking as Much Coffee as You Like</h2>
            <p>"What I tell patients is, if you like coffee, go ahead and drink as much as you want and can,"
                says Dr. Peter Martin, director of the Institute for Coffee Studies at Vanderbilt University.
                He's even developed a metric for monitoring your dosage: If you are having trouble sleeping,
                cut back on your last cup of the day. From there, he says, "If you drink that much, it's not
                going to do you any harm, and it might actually help you. A lot."<br>
                Officially, the American Medical Association recommends conservatively that "moderate tea or
                coffee drinking likely has no negative effect on health, as long as you live an otherwise healthy
                lifestyle." That is a lackluster endorsement in light of so much recent glowing research. Not only
                have most of coffee's purported ill effects been disproven -- the most recent review fails to link
                it the development of hypertension -- but we have so, so much information about its benefits. We believe
                they extend from preventing Alzheimer's disease to protecting the liver. What we know goes beyond
                small-scale studies or limited observations. The past couple of years have seen findings, that, taken
                together, suggest that we should embrace coffee for reasons beyond the benefits of caffeine, and that we
                might go so far as to consider it a nutrient.</p><br>
            <p>The most recent findings that support coffee as a panacea will make their premiere this December in the
                American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Coffee, researchers found, appears to reduce the risk of type 2
                diabetes. "There have been many metabolic studies that have shown that caffeine, in the short term,
                increases your blood glucose levels and increases insulin resistance," Shilpa Bhupathiraju, a research
                fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health's Department of Nutrition and the study's lead author, told
                me. But "those findings really didn't translate into an increased risk for diabetes long-term." During the
                over 20 years of follow-up, and controlling for all major lifestyle and dietary risk factors, coffee consumption,
                regardless of caffeine content, was associated with an 8 percent decrease in the risk of type 2 diabetes in
                women. In men, the reduction was 4 percent for regular coffee and 7 percent for decaf.</p>
            <p>The findings were arrived at rigorously, relying on data from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals
                Follow-Up Study, two prospective studies that followed almost 80,000 women and over 40,000 men from the 1980s through
                2008. Although self-reported, the data is believed to be extremely reliable because it comes from individuals who know
                more about health and disease than the average American (the downside, of course, is that results won't always apply to
                the general population -- but in this case, Bhupathuraju explained that there's no reason to believe that the biological
                effects seen in health professionals wouldn't be seen in everyone else).</p>
