# Coffee Culture

###WDI Project 2 
This is a coffee-themed social forum created using MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js (and a ton of really cool npm packages like Mongoose, Passport and bcrypt!)

### User Stories
The aim of this project is to create a MEN Stack application that incorporates authorized signup and login using Passport. The saved posts from the user are then uploaded to a MongoDB database and stored for other users to see.
 
#### A user... 
* A user can sign up to our site
* A user can log in to our site
* A user will be notified if either of these processes aren't successful (error handling)
* A user will be able to see every post ever created descending by time created
* A user will be presented with edit/delete buttons for their own posts
* A user can edit their own posts
* A user can delete their own posts
* As a user, if I am logged in and I go "Home", I can read this month's coffee-related op-ed

### Installation Instructions
1. Git Clone this repository
2. `cd` to the project file, `npm install`

### Revisions
* I had a beautiful wireframe for this project that took an entire wall at work... in a sad twist of fate, it was erased
* I would like to refactor a good portion of this code in the near future! 

### Future Features
I plan on incorporating the ability to comment on other people's posts. In addition to this, I plan on creating some sort of direct message inbox. Lastly, I would like to go back and implement logic to show the new posts since last visit highlighted somehow. Cool!
